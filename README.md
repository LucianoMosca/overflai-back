**OverflAI**

With the recent advancements in AI and the growing reliance on AI by the majority of the software development and academic communities, we aim to create an AI-integrated forum. This platform will allow users to access high-end AI APIs for free while sharing the AI's responses with the community.

This collaborative approach will enable users to correct inaccurate or unclear answers and approve accurate ones.

Our platform is particularly beneficial for those who are just starting to learn new skills. It ensures that the knowledge they acquire through AI is accurate and allows them to connect with experts in various fields.

In this repository, you will find the project's backend, built with Node.js and TypeScript.
